python is a good language to start with for making a roguelike
there's a lot that can be done
and it's very usable and fast to learn
many roguelikes have been made in python
it's a smooth ride to start with

C and C++ are GOOD, but they are harder to learn as a beginner (am I a beginner?)

DO NOT START WITH THE DREAM roguelike
build some EXP making a smaller roguelike
I.e. we are NOT working on mirth yet
yet!
but we will... : )

Character

Maps

FOV

pathfinding

monsters

combat?

items

GUI

saving


what does a small roguelike need?>
a mechanic!
what's the core of the game?
if that#s the ONLY thing in the game, is it still fun?
{
up and down levels of a dream world
higher level you move more space (it's broken up and can't be traverse) and you're more like to wake up
lower levels you move less space (it's more contiguous and can be treaversed) and you're less likely to wake up
} is this fun?

start small - expand as required


r/roguelikedev is a good resource
roguebasin
roguelike radio
assets??


libtcod - python library

rexpaint? 
tilesets are available (or I could draw my own and git gud)


starting points:
core mechanic
visual/sfx
THEME - dream vs nightmare
Music - nightclub
{sci fi....
pirates
